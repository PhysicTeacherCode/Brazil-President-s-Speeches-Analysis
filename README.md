# Presidential Inaugural Speech Analysis — Brazil (1889–2025)

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the inaugural speeches of all Brazilian presidents, from **Deodoro da Fonseca (1889)** to **Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2025)**.  
The project combines **data science**, **NLP**, and **machine learning** methods to study how presidential discourse has evolved throughout the history of the Brazilian Republic.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

## Objectives

- Collect, clean, and structure the inaugural speeches of every Brazilian president  
- Apply **sentiment analysis** to identify the emotional tone of each speech  
- Use **topic modeling** (e.g., LDA, BERTopic) to uncover the main themes discussed  
- Perform simpler textual analyses, including:
  - most frequent words  
  - n-grams  
  - lexical diversity  
  - speech length over time  
- Compare linguistic and thematic trends across different political eras of Brazil

## Methods & Tools

- **Python**, Jupyter Notebooks  
- **NLP Libraries:** spaCy, NLTK, gensim, scikit-learn  
- **Machine Learning:** sentiment classification, topic modeling  
- **Data Visualization:** matplotlib, seaborn
- **Transformers** (BERT-based models) for improved sentiment and topic extraction
